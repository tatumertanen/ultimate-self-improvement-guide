# Sleep: The Ultimate Guide To Optimizing Your Sleep

## Introduction

Sleep affects your whole life. If you were thinking about improving at one thing, it should be sleep.

Many people have problems with falling asleep, waking up in the middle of the night, or waking up too early. There are many reasons why this could happen. There are also many ways you can prevent it. We have some techniques and methods that will help you sleep way better. And they are all easy and free.

## What Is Good Sleep

The best sleep is the one you get when you wake up feeling refreshed. Different people have different needs, but most people need 7-9 hours of sleep a night. It depends a lot on your age. If you are a teenager, you need more sleep than an adult. If you are older, you need less sleep.

Here is a table that shows how much sleep you need at different ages:
| Age | Sleep Needed |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 6-13 years | 9-11 hours |
| 14-17 years | 8-10 hours |
| 18-64 years | 7-9 hours |
| 65+ years | 7-8 hours |

This is a good rule of thumb, but it's not always true. Some people need more sleep than others. If you are not sure how much sleep you need, you can try to sleep for 7-9 hours and see how you feel. If you feel tired, you need more sleep. If you feel refreshed, you may not need more sleep.

Optimally you shouldn't wake up to an alarm clock. Waking up to an alarm clock can cause stress first thing in the morning. [source (need to be added)].

## Waking Up

What you do in the morning affects not only the rest of your day, but also your sleep the next night. There is a few good techniques that will not only help you wake up, but start the day right.

1. **View sunlight in the morning.** Sunlight wakes up your circadian clock. Viewing sunlight in the morning sets the time you will start to feel sleepy. It's one of the most imporant things to be sleepy at the right time. You should do this within 30-60 minutes of waking up. **You should view the sun for 10 minutes.** It does not work with sunglasses or through a window. You shouldn't look at the sun directly, just being in the light. **On cloudy days you should view the sun for 20 minutes. On very overcast days you should view the sun for 30-60 minutes.** If you are in a place where you can't view the sun, you can use artificial lights, but most are not enough to wake you up.

2. **Wake up the same time every day.**
3. **Get out of bed as soon as you can.**
4. **Go to a cold shower.** A cold shower will not only wake you up, but according to research it will boost your dopamine (the motivation hormone) up to 250% for the following few hours. It's almost a superpower. A recommended time is around 30 seconds, but the most imporant thing is that you kind of don't want to go in. You should feel like you want to get out of the shower. Don't go in a shower that is too cold, to avoid any risks to your health. If you have any concerns, you should skip this or at least consult a doctor.
