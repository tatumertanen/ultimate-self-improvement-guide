# A Message From The Founder

We believe in being fully transparent about how our website operates. As an open source self-improvement guide, our goal is to provide valuable information and resources to help individuals grow and develop. We want our users to trust that the content we provide is accurate, unbiased, and created with their best interests in mind.

To maintain this transparency, we make our source code publicly available on GitHub. This allows anyone to review how our website functions, suggest improvements, or even contribute their own changes. We believe this openness helps foster a sense of community and collaboration around personal growth.

In addition, we strive to be upfront about any affiliations, sponsorships, or partnerships that may influence the content on our site. If we recommend a product or service, you can trust that it's because we genuinely believe in its value, not because we've been paid to promote it.

Our commitment to transparency extends to our privacy practices as well. We will never sell your personal information to third parties or use it for any purpose beyond improving your experience on our website.

We appreciate your trust in us as a resource for self-improvement, and we pledge to always operate with integrity and openness. If you ever have any questions or concerns about the content on our site or how we run things behind the scenes, please don't hesitate to reach out.
