# A Message From The Founders

We believe in being fully transparent about how our website operates. As an open source self-improvement guide built on VitePress, our goal is to provide valuable information and resources to help individuals grow and develop. We want our users to trust that the content we provide is accurate, unbiased, and created with their best interests in mind.

To maintain this transparency, we make our content publicly available on GitHub. This allows anyone to review the information we share, suggest improvements, or even contribute their own changes. We believe this openness helps foster a sense of community and collaboration around personal growth. We encourage you to join our friendly Discord discussion server to share your thoughts, ideas, and suggestions for improving the guide. If you'd like to contribute directly, feel free to submit a pull request on our GitHub repository. We value your input and appreciate any contributions that can help make this resource even better.

Our commitment to transparency extends to our privacy practices as well. We will never sell your personal information to third parties or use it for any purpose beyond improving your experience on our website.

We appreciate your trust in us as a resource for self-improvement, and we pledge to always operate with integrity and openness. If you ever have any questions or concerns about the content on our site, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you on your personal growth journey, and we value your feedback and support.
