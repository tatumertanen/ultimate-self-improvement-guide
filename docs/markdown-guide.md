# VitePress Markdown Guide for Self-Improvement Guide Editors

## Introduction

This guide will help you understand how to use Markdown in VitePress to edit and enhance our self-improvement guide. VitePress extends standard Markdown with additional features, making it powerful for creating rich documentation.

## Basic Markdown Syntax

### Headers

Use `#` for headers. More `#` means smaller headers:

# Main Title (H1)

## Section Title (H2)

### Subsection Title (H3)

### Emphasis

-   _Italic_: Surround text with single asterisks or underscores: `*italic*` or `_italic_`
-   **Bold**: Use double asterisks or underscores: `**bold**` or `__bold__`
-   **_Bold and Italic_**: Combine both: `***bold and italic***`

### Lists

Unordered lists use `-`, `*`, or `+`:

-   Item 1
-   Item 2
    -   Subitem 2.1

Ordered lists use numbers:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Links

Create links like this: `[Link Text](URL)`

Example: [VitePress Documentation](https://vitepress.dev/)

### Images

Add images like this: `![Alt Text](image-url.jpg)`

## VitePress-Specific Features

VitePress provides custom containers for highlighting content:

::: tip

Link to other pages in your VitePress site using relative paths:

`[Getting Started](./getting-started.md)`
