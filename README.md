# Ultimate Self-Improvement Guide

This project is a directory for methods and guides related to the self-improvement trend. This project is open source to keep it transparent and allow easy modifications to any of the guides for any reason. We will in future have a discord server, where discussions related to this project will take place. Those can for example be related to the updates to the guides.

The project website uses (VitePress)[https://vitepress.dev/] which uses `.md` files for the content, for easy editing without high technical skills needed. There will be a contribution (= suggestion/editing/updating) guide in the future.
