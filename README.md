# Ultimate Self-Improvement Guide

![Habitmaxx Banner](/banner.png)

Welcome to the Ultimate Self-Improvement Guide! This project is a collection of methods and guides related to self-improvement. We aim to keep the project open and easy to update so that the guides can be improved over time. We have a Discord server at https://discord.gg/mKtJDGHRpj where we discuss updates to the guides.

The project website is built using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), which uses `.md` files for content. This makes it easy to edit without needing a lot of technical skills. If you want to contribute by making suggestions, editing, or updating the guides, check out our contribution guide at https://habitmaxx.com/contributing.
